## Novel plotting: Snowflake method

1. Write a one-sentence synopsis of your story
2. Expand your synopsis into a full paragraph
3. Create a summary sheet for each major character

6. Expand each paragraph from your main synopsis to a full page
7. Expand your character sheets as much as you can
8. Develop a list or spreadsheet of all the scenes needed to tell the story
9. Write a description of each scene
10. Use all of the above to write the first draft of your novel

## Novel plotting: 3-act structure
### ACT 1 — THE BEGINNING
#### 1. Opening Scene	
Sets the tone for the story and introduces the protagonist.
#### 2. Setup	
Scenes that introduce the world & supporting characters, and also hint at changes to come.
#### 3. Inciting Incident	
The surprise moment that turns the protagonist’s world upside down and kicks off the main plot.
#### 4. Call to Action	
How do the characters react to the inciting incident? What choice must the protagonist make?
### ACT II, PART 1 — THE MIDDLE
#### 5. The Choice	
How does the protagonist decide to deal with the problem? What are the stakes?
#### 6. Rising Action / Mounting Problems	
Troubles mount as the conflict kicks into high gear. What keeps the protagonist going?
#### 7. Midpoint / Reversal	
A surprise event that wrecks the plan and raises the stakes, often after a temporary triumph.
### ACT II, PART 2 — AFTER THE REVERSAL
#### 8. More Troubles	
There is fallout from the midpoint, continuing the conflict as problems pile up.
#### 9. Disaster	
A moment when everything goes wrong and the goal appears impossible to achieve.
#### 10. Turning Point	
New ideas or fresh inspiration offer hope and set up the story’s final act.
### ACT III — RESOLUTION
#### 11. Plan / Resolve
All the pieces are moved into place for the finale. Subplots tie together and the stakes reach a peak.
#### 12. Climax
The protagonist comes face to face with the antagonist or main obstacle and is victorious… or fails.
#### 13. Denouement
After the climax, the protagonist and/or world have changed. A final scene provides closure to the story.
